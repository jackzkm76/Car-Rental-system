# Car-Rental-system
A car rental system is a software application that allows users to rent vehicles from a car rental company. The system can be implemented using an object-oriented programming language such as Java. The system will typically have classes for representing the different types of vehicles, classes for representing customers and rental transactions, and classes for performing various tasks such as calculating rental fees, checking vehicle availability, and processing payments.
 # Modules
1.)	Customer
	A customer will be required to enter a name and can rent a car

2.)	Vehicle management
	This module will allow the system to keep track of the different types of vehicles available for rent, as well as their current status (e.g. available, rented,

3.)	Rental and Billing
	This module will handle the rental transactions, including calculating rental fees, processing payments.

Object Oriented Approach:
It is necessary to understand some of the concepts used
extensively in object-oriented programming. These include:
• Objects
• Classes
• Data abstraction and encapsulation
• Polymorphism
• Inheritance
